# PWA App Store

This is the repository for a Progressive Web App store. PWAs are web apps that are completely or partially capable of functioning offline. They can be installed by the user on mobile devices and can be very close to native apps. The goal of this open source project is to build a common place ("App Store") for users to search and install PWAs and give common people access this growing development trend.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alexanderluna/pwa-app-store.git
cd pwa-app-store

yarn install
yarn start
```

to deploy the app to github pages:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
